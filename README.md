Soar
====

My first 3D spaceship shooter that involves multiple missions, awesome battles, and more.

###Introduction###

####Why is this now open source?####

Soar was a nice project I did back in the summer of 2012 to see if I could pull something off that was awesome.
I believe I achieved that goal, as I did get 100,000 people to visit my website because of it.

Now it is the summer of 2013, and I want to show people what I did to make this a reality. Jumping into 3D is a crazy
task, especially for a then 1-year experienced programmer. This is my first real big project that I made open-source.

I love open-source projects, and I really didn't appreciate them until 2013. 

####What can I do with it?####

This is technically under the Apache v2 license, and you can read more about it here:

####What does it look like?####

That's a very good question!

###How To Play###
I did not include the assets in this repository because they are around 2 GB in size. 
Instead, you can download it:

[Download Soar 3D](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/92848165/soar3Dsetup.msi)

*If the download goes down, that means Dropbox took it down, email me at robert@gawdzik.net.*

###End Notes###
Thank you for all the support I recieved over the summer developing this awesome project. I couldn't of done
it without the help of my collegues.
